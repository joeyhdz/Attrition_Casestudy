## Case Study on Attrition of employees

### Description: 
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

### Task:
We have been provided a dataset to perform a data analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition.  You should identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover (backed up by evidence provided by analysis). Experiments and analysis must be conducted in R. You will also be asked to build a model to predict attrition.  Finally, you will develop an RShiny App to visualize some of the relationships or lack thereof.

## Snippets of The Project:
### Correlation of Variables:
To fully understand attrition and its relationship to multiple variables we will create a correlation plot heat map. This heat map will illustrate which variables have a positive, neutral, or negative correlative relationship with attrition so that we can further explore each piece of data.

### Attrition Percentage Within Each Job Role:
Our investigation allowed us to discover that FritoLay is experiencing the greatest percentage of turnover within each role in the following ways:

   * Sales Representative - 45.28% of the individuals in this role left.
   * Human Resources - 22.22% of the individuals in this role left.
   * Laboratory Technicians - 19.61% of the individuals in this role left.
